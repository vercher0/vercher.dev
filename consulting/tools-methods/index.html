        An overview of how I design, build, document, and support systems that must function reliably in complex, high-stakes environments.

  <!-- Optional: Context / Why This Matters -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Organizations often invest in tools or initiatives without clear ownership, documentation, or long-term support. This page describes how I approach systems work in a way that emphasizes durability, accountability, and effective handoff rather than one-time delivery.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Core Content -->
  <section>
    <h2>How the Work Gets Done</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Data and Decision Infrastructure.</strong> I work directly with clinical, operational, and financial data to design analytics and decision-support systems. This includes querying and validating data, structuring reporting, and building tools that support consistent, explainable decision-making over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The emphasis is on reliability and clarity rather than complexity, ensuring that leaders understand not just what the data shows, but how and why it supports decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>System and Process Design.</strong> I use process mapping, systems analysis, and iterative design to understand how work actually happens today, including where data, workflow, incentives, and responsibility break down. From there, I help redesign workflows, reporting, and governance structures to reduce friction, surface tradeoffs, and support better outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work prioritizes fit over theory and durability over optimization.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Implementation, Documentation, and Automation.</strong> When appropriate, I build and implement solutions directly. This may include analytics dashboards, reporting pipelines, lightweight automation, or supporting infrastructure that reduces manual effort and operational risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      I place strong emphasis on clear documentation and knowledge transfer so that systems can be understood, maintained, and adapted by internal teams. Automation is used deliberately to improve reliability and reduce ongoing burden, not to obscure how systems work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where ongoing support is needed, it is scoped intentionally to reinforce sustainability, address drift, and support transition rather than create long-term dependency.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Optional: Tools & Methods / Technical Notes -->
  <section>
    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      I work comfortably across a range of platforms and environments, including SQL-based data systems, analytics and business intelligence tools, scripting and automation, and collaborative documentation and versioning workflows. Tool choice is driven by organizational needs, data maturity, and maintainability rather than trend or preference.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recent work has included analytics and reporting platforms used in healthcare environments, SQL-backed data systems, and scripting for validation and automation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Optional: Outcomes / Measures of Success -->
  <section>
    <h2>How Success Is Measured</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Leaders can explain how the system works and why it produces the results it does</li>
      <li>Teams can maintain and adapt the system without external dependency</li>
      <li>Decisions improve in clarity, consistency, or accountability</li>
      <li>Manual effort and fragility are reduced through appropriate automation</li>
      <li>The system continues to function as priorities, people, or data change</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
