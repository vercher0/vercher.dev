        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I work on systems — technical, organizational, and civic — that shape
          how people experience care, governance, and daily life.

        <h2>What I Work On</h2>

        <p>
          My professional work sits at the intersection of healthcare operations,
          data and analytics, and public accountability. I focus on designing and
          improving systems that need to be both technically sound and socially
          trustworthy.
        </p>

        <p>
          This includes healthcare analytics and business intelligence, infection
          prevention and patient safety, and governance work in local government
          and community institutions.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          I began my career in military medicine and later moved into nursing,
          infection prevention, and health system leadership. Over time, my work
          has increasingly focused on data, systems design, and the ways complex
          organizations make decisions under uncertainty.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside my professional work, I’ve remained active in civic service,
          serving on boards and commissions and working on issues related to
          planning, ethics, and public trust.
